# ECG ARYTHMIA CLASSIFICATION
This project seeks to develop a CNN capable of classifying pathological heartbeats in ECG signals. The MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset was used for this task, it is is used to benchmark NNs on temporal pattern classification. For this task I settled on a one-dimentsional CNN, with the architecture being inspired by the work of Wu et al. (2021). The end result was a general classifier that could identify 10 different types of arrythmias with ~95% accuracy. To push the investigation futher I also compared training the network on single patients (accuracy: M=97.778%) versus a transfer learning version (accuracy: M=97.834%) of per patient classification (where the network is first trained on all patients (-1) and then the deeper layers are retrained on a single patient). Although showing promise, the difference between the two methods at the sample size was insignificant in the end, this is likely a consequence of the relatively few number of frozen (transfer learning) parameters versus the total number of trainable parameters. For this project, I ended up creating the entire training, data processing, and testing pipeline (from network architecture to hyperparameter tuning).
